Create a multiple choice quiz with a timer

I created a multiple choice quiz with a timer that deducts time if the user gets a question wrong.

If the timer runs out the quiz is over.
When the quiz is over, I can save my initials and score.

(I will change this repo name later, presently the file structure helps me keep my sanity with dozens of folders to sort through while going through VS Code and github.)
